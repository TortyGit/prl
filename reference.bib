abstract = {An extremely common bottleneck encountered in statistical learning algorithms is inversion of huge covariance matrices, examples being in evaluating Gaussian likelihoods for a large number of data points. We propose general parallel algorithms for inverting positive definite matrices, which are nearly rank deficient. Such matrix inversions are needed in Gaussian process computations, among other settings, and remain a bottleneck even with the increasing literature on low rank approximations. We propose a general class of algorithms for parallelizing computations to dramatically speed up computation time by orders of magnitude exploiting multicore architectures. We implement our algorithm on a cloud computing platform, providing pseudo and actual code. The algorithm can be easily implemented on any multicore parallel computing resource. Some illustrations are provided to give a flavor for the gains and what becomes possible in freeing up this bottleneck.},

abstract = {There are two different ways of describing uynamicu systems: (i) bymeans of state variables and (ii) by input/output relations. The first method may be regarded as an axiornatization of Newton’s laws of mechanics and is taken to be the basic definition of a system.It is then shown (in the linear case) that the input/output relations determine only one part of a system, that which is completely observable and completely controllable. Using the theory of controllability and observability, methods are given for calculating irreducible realization of a given impulse-response matrix. In particular, an explicit procedure is given to determine the minimal number of state variables necessary to realize a given transfer-function matrix. Difficulties arising from the use of reducible realizations are discussed briefly.},

@article{Friston2003a,
abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input–state–output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

Further we test linear hypotheses about the cointegration vectors. The asymptotic distribution of these test statistics are found and the first is described by a natural multivariate version of the usual test for unit root in an autoregressive process, and the other is a $\chi$2 test.},

@article{Pujol2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography reconstruction of white matter pathways can help guide brain tumor resection. However, DTI tracts are complex mathematical objects and the validity of tractography-derived information in clinical settings has yet to be fully established. To address this issue, we initiated the DTI Challenge, an international working group of clinicians and scientists whose goal was to provide standardized evaluation of tractography methods for neurosurgery. The purpose of this empirical study was to evaluate different tractography techniques in the first DTI Challenge workshop.

METHODS: Eight international teams from leading institutions reconstructed the pyramidal tract in four neurosurgical cases presenting with a glioma near the motor cortex. Tractography methods included deterministic, probabilistic, filtered, and global approaches. Standardized evaluation of the tracts consisted in the qualitative review of the pyramidal pathways by a panel of neurosurgeons and DTI experts and the quantitative evaluation of the degree of agreement among methods.

RESULTS: The evaluation of tractography reconstructions showed a great interalgorithm variability. Although most methods found projections of the pyramidal tract from the medial portion of the motor strip, only a few algorithms could trace the lateral projections from the hand, face, and tongue area. In addition, the structure of disagreement among methods was similar across hemispheres despite the anatomical distortions caused by pathological tissues.

CONCLUSIONS: The DTI Challenge provides a benchmark for the standardized evaluation of tractography methods on neurosurgical data. This study suggests that there are still limitations to the clinical use of tractography for neurosurgical decision making.},

@article{Fan2008,
abstract = {Variable selection plays an important role in high dimensional statistical modeling which nowadays appears in many areas and is key to various scientific discoveries. For problems of large scale or dimensionality \$p\$, estimation accuracy and computational cost are two top concerns. In a recent paper, Candes and Tao (2007) propose the Dantzig selector using \$L\_1\$ regularization and show that it achieves the ideal risk up to a logarithmic factor \$\backslash log p\$. Their innovative procedure and remarkable result are challenged when the dimensionality is ultra high as the factor \$\backslash log p\$ can be large and their uniform uncertainty principle can fail.   Motivated by these concerns, we introduce the concept of sure screening and propose a sure screening method based on a correlation learning, called the Sure Independence Screening (SIS), to reduce dimensionality from high to a moderate scale that is below sample size. In a fairly general asymptotic framework, the correlation learning is shown to have the sure screening property for even exponentially growing dimensionality. As a methodological extension, an iterative SIS (ISIS) is also proposed to enhance its finite sample performance. With dimension reduced accurately from high to below sample size, variable selection can be improved on both speed and accuracy, and can then be accomplished by a well-developed method such as the SCAD, Dantzig selector, Lasso, or adaptive Lasso. The connections of these penalized least-squares methods are also elucidated.},
